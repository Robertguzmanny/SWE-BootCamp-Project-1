        Though it has its touristy share, the Zona Colonial is still a lively
        spot of the Dominicans which means you can get a good dose of the daily
        Dominican life. When I first moved to Santo Domingo I initially did not
        want to live in the Colonial Zone as I thought it was way too touristy.
        But I was completely wrong! When Dominicans are meeting up, they often
        head towards the Zona Colonial, the majority of houses here are still
        inhabited by locals and during the weekend you cant count the hundreds
        of Dominican families who are visiting the area to enjoy some free time.
        Although the Zona Colonial might not be an authentic Dominican barrio,
        it still is a place mainly influenced by locals and therefore one of the
        best places to be and to live in Santo Domingo.

        The Zona Colonial is the historic district of Santo Domingo and the
        oldest continuously inhabited European-established settlement in the
        Americas, dating back more than a half-millennium, to the years around
        1500. When speaking about the Zona Colonial in Santo Domingo, people
        also often refer to “La Zona”, “Ciudad Colonial”, “Colonial District” or
        “Colonial Zone”</b

        The Zona Colonial is located in Santo Domingo, the capital of the
        Dominican Republic. The colonial district is protected by water from two
        sides, the Ozama River to the east and the Caribbean Sea to the
        west.Officially, Santo Domingo consists of two cities, Santo Domingo de
        Guzman and Santo Domingo Este. The Colonial Zone is part of the first
        one, which is located on the right bank of the Ozama River.</b
