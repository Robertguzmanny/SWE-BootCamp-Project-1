        All visits to Santiago include an obligatory stop at El Monumento, the
        city’s iconic white marble tower, circled on all sides by a multilevel
        garden and boasting panoramic views over the entire city. You can tour
        the interior of the 67-meter (220-foot) high monument, named after the
        heroes of the Restoration War (1863-1865) who died in the fight to
        regain the DR’s independence from Spain. Spread over five floors are
        displays of the DR’s major historical battles, as well as paintings that
        Spanish artist Vela Zanetti created during his exile after the Spanish
        Civil War. On the fifth floor is the ultimate reward: a grand panoramic
        view of the city of Santiago from a wraparound balcony, with the
        Cordillera Central mountain range in the distance.

        It was named, Trujillo's Monument to Peace, in honour of the president.
        In 1961, on the death of Trujillo, the monument was renamed, "Monument
        to the Heroes of the Restoration", to honour the heroes of the 1863-65
        war.</b

        Originally constructed in 1944 by Rafael Trujillo, aka El Jefe, who
        ruled the nation for 30 years, this imposing monument—set on a hill in
        downtown Santiago—was intended to honor the dictator himself. Following
        Trujillo's assassination in 1961, it was renamed and rededicated, and
        now honors those who fought in the Dominican Restoration War from 1863
        to 1865. Bronze statues of the generals that led the country in its
        struggle for independence from Spain stand on the steps of the
        eight-story monument.</b
